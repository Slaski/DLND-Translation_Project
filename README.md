# Deep Learning Nanodegre Foundations

## Project 4 - Translation Project

This is the fourth project from the Deep Learning Nanodegre from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). In this project we have to train a neural network machine translation to translate sentences from English to French.

## Dependencies

* numpy
* jupyter notebook
* tensorflow 1.0

Install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and/or [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Tensorflow can be installed via this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal to see the code.
